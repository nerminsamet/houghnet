## Updates

(August, 2022) Our extended paper is accepted to IEEE Transaction on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). 

(April, 2021) We extended HoughNet with other visual detection tasks: video object detection, instance segmentation, keypoint detection and 3D object detection. 

- Extended the voting idea to the temporal domain by developing a new video object detection method. **Code is avaliable at [HoughNet-VID](https://github.com/nerminsamet/houghnet-vid) repo.**
- Inspired from [BlendMask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00309), we extended HoughNet for instance segmentation. More details regarding training and network architecture are in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06773) and [supplementary material](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qDC-jj3xW7WNB2xyo7mpKqfaPr_s_fki/view?usp=sharing). 
- We showed the effectivenes of HoughNet for keypoint detection and 3D object detection.
- We improved the source code of HoughNet by increasing its modularity and train speed. 

More details can be found in [arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06773).


## Summary
Object detection methods typically rely on only local evidence. For example, to detect the mouse in the image below,
only the features extracted at/around the mouse are used. In contrast, HoughNet is able to utilize long-range (i.e. far away) evidence, too.
Below, on the right, the votes that support the detection of the mouse are shown: in addition to the local evidence,
far away but semantically relevant objects, the two keyboards, vote for the mouse.

HoughNet is a one-stage, anchor-free, voting-based, bottom-up object detection method. Inspired by the Generalized Hough Transform,
HoughNet determines the presence of an object at a certain location by the sum of the
votes cast on that location. Votes are collected from both near and long-distance locations
based on a log-polar vote field. Thanks to this voting mechanism, HoughNet is able to integrate both near and long-range,
class-conditional evidence for visual recognition, thereby generalizing and enhancing current object detection methodology,
which typically relies on only local evidence. On the COCO dataset, HoughNet achieves 46.4 AP (and 65.1 AP<sub>50</sub>),
performing on par with the state-of-the-art in bottom-up object detection and outperforming most  major one-stage and two-stage methods.
We further validate the effectiveness of HoughNet in another task, namely, "labels to photo" image generation by integrating the
voting module to two different GAN models and showing that the accuracy is significantly improved in both cases.

## Highlights
- Hough voting idea is applied through a log-polar vote field to utilize short and long-range evidence in a deep
learning model for generic object detection.
- Our best single model achieves *46.4* AP on COCO test-dev.
- HoughNet is effective for small objects (+2.5 AP points over the baseline).
- We provide Hough voting as a [module](src/lib/models/networks/hough_module.py) to be used in another works.
- We provide COCO `minitrain` as a mini training set for COCO. It is useful for hyperparameter tuning and
  reducing the cost of ablation experiments. `minitrain` is strongly  positively correlated with the performance of
  the same model trained on `train2017`. For experiments,
  object instance statistics and download please refer to [COCO minitrain](https://github.com/giddyyupp/coco-minitrain)
